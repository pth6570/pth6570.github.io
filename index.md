### Bio & Professional Background
I have primarily worked in the fields of public health and social science research and evaluation. From 2017 to 2022, I was employed at the University of Maryland - Baltimore where I participated in the evaluation of programs intended to improve well-being of children, youth, and families as part of a Quality Improvement Center. Since 2022, I have been employed by the University of Connecticut where I conduct research and evaluation as part of another Quality Improvement Center related to family reunification.

### Earth Data Science Interests
In this Earth Data science series, I am interested in building my programming skills and beginning to build a portfolio of projects specifically related to earth and environmental sciences.
