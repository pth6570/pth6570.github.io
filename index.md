### Earth Data Science Interests
In this Earth Data science series, I am interested in building my programming skills and beginning to build a portfolio of projects specifically related to earth and environmental sciences. I enjoy learning about pretty much anything, but a few topics of particular interest to me are: mapping of environmental factors and associated disease risks, environmental justice issues, and/or anything related to biodiversity and conservation.
